When people said that it's more difficult to find the correct 
information on the internet than to find *the* informations 
themseves, they weren't kidding.

It took me several hours to finally found the right tutorial 
slash guide to finally deploy this little Hugo blog as its 
own Github Pages.

So, shoutout to the owner and writer of this 
[page](https://youngkin.github.io/post/createafreeblogsite/). 
And to anyone else looking to deploy Hugo on Github Pages, 
go read their guide––it's so clear and, what's better, it works.
